# movieslistapi
Makin an app need an api fine i'll do it myself
So anyone who reads, please im just a kid dont bully me 
i wanted to flex my coding skills and making an android app was to me the best way
First thing came to my mind was to make a movie streamin app
i made a json api to show it in my application
and stored the movie videos in firebase storage and it works fine
